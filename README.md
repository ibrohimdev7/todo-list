# To-Do List App
    This is a simple To-Do List application that allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages the browser's localStorage to save tasks, ensuring that they persist even after the page is reloaded.

# Features
    Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your list.
    Mark as Complete: Check off tasks as you complete them, and the app will remember their status.
    Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list when they're no longer needed.
    Persistent Storage: All tasks and their completion status are saved in localStorage, so your list is always available.
