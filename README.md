# To-Do List App

This is a simple To-Do List application that allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages the browser's `localStorage` to save tasks, ensuring that they persist even after the page is reloaded.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your list.
- **Mark as Complete:** Check off tasks as you complete them, and the app will remember their status.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the list when they're no longer needed.
- **Persistent Storage:** All tasks and their completion status are saved in `localStorage`, so your list is always available.
